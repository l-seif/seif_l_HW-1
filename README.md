HW#1 Recreated, Situ and Laila.

My full name is Situ Ranjit. I am from Nepal. Since i completed my highschool back home, i decided to pursue my higher studies here in Canada. As being a Nepalese i had never spoken English before. I'm slowly adapting the environment and getting more familiar with the people and it's surroundings.

I had studied Computer Sciene during my highschool by which i had basic knowledge about coding. But now i think like i am actually a DESIGN PERSON. But i am looking forward to know more and getting used to coding too. Since i have been enrolled in IDP3, i want to see myself as a Designer in future. I want to grow myself. But it has been tough to get things as everyone speaks english way too fast still im slowing getting used to it and taking things easily as i am a very calm and time taking person.I believe everything i do will surely make sense some day.

Besides studies, i am so much interested into basketball. There was a time when i used to play every single day. It helped me a lot as it keeps me physically and mentally fit, cooperate with teammates and meet new people during tournaments. I have started being extrovert since the time i started playing. 

Apart from that, I have a fear of reptiles. I even don't want to see them. Specially snakes.
