HW#1 Recreated, Situ and Laila.

SITU

My full name is Situ Ranjit. I am from Nepal. Since i completed my highschool back home, i decided to pursue my higher studies here in Canada. As being a Nepalese i had never spoken English before. I'm slowly adapting the environment and getting more familiar with the people and it's surroundings.

I had studied Computer Sciene during my highschool by which i had basic knowledge about coding. But now i think like i am actually a DESIGN PERSON. But i am looking forward to know more and getting used to coding too. Since i have been enrolled in IDP3, i want to see myself as a Designer in future. I want to grow myself. But it has been tough to get things as everyone speaks english way too fast still im slowing getting used to it and taking things easily as i am a very calm and time taking person.I believe everything i do will surely make sense some day.

Besides studies, i am so much interested into basketball. There was a time when i used to play every single day. It helped me a lot as it keeps me physically and mentally fit, cooperate with teammates and meet new people during tournaments. I have started being extrovert since the time i started playing. 

Apart from that, I have a fear of reptiles. I even don't want to see them. Specially snakes.

LAILA

~ My full name is Laila 'Fadi' Seif. It means in arabic orgin Night 'Redeemer' Sword!
~ My background is (in rough numbers): 50% Palestinian, 25% Lebanese, 25% Syrian... though that is what I mainly am, my great grandma was turkish, so I call my grandma "Anna".
~ 19 years old. May 22, 2005.



MY FEARS!
~ I am horrified of the pitch black or the erry lighting in horror movies where you see but not enough to make it out.
~ Disfiguration (especially in a demonic sence)
~ Jumpscares. Whatever it is may not be scary, but ot jumping at me is enough for me to flip out.



HOBBIES!

~ Another part of me is I have always been into the arts. Other than proforming arts, excluding a tiny bit of music back then (Alto Saxophone, ukulele... sadly may have loss some skill since it was so long ago). Others;
    - Sketch/draw traditionally + digitally
    - Design using Adobe softwares* sweep, Canva and Photopea
    - Sew, have created sweaters, clown Halloween costume, pet pillows, etc.
    - Pottery back then when I was young teen
    - Painting, mainly of birds and nature once in a while when I get a sudden urge
    - Photography + videography*, mainly while I was running yearbook as Student Rep and for various school events/community acts

~ I love baking and cooking. I even have my own recipes such as Turkish Tiramisu (classic tiramisu with Turkish Coffee), Classic Cheesecake with a honey crust, and Maple Banana Bread.

~ I normally clean and organize a lot! I'm know at work (Storybook Gardens, I am a Building Attendant and Amenities Team Lead) to know where everything goes because I moved it there.

MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND SKILLS!

~ Going into my path of design:
    - I have worked with clients before during grade 11 co-op, and quite a few have used my work. i.e. "Women Rock for Men's Mental Health".
    - London South Collegiate's 100th year anniversary front sign redesign (saved it from the Alumni's version... they broke every design rule there could have been)
    - Used to be the Yearbook Student Rep for two years running. Sadly, my part of the work and more was put in but majority of members and teachers did not do the same, so in both years it fell apart.
